# hello-world
Just another repository
My names are Emmanuel Chimnemerem Umunna,  the founder/NED of Bluetech Internet GmBH, with hopes of being Elis <AG>.
I am a young developer with the mindset of an entrepreneur, lawyer and a financial analyst.
I recently immigrated to the United States of America, with the hopes of getting greener pastures.
I love music, commerce, art, dancing, education, finance, politics and leadership.
I am eager to be a part of developing technologies in the United States of America, Europe, Asia and Africa.
I believe in giving to the needy through the aid of my family charity organization (Elias and Grace charity foundation).
